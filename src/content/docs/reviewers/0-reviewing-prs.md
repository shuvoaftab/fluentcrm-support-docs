description: How to review PRs for Astro documentation.
---

Astro prides itself on our approach to [community-driven documentation](/about-docs/how-we-doc/). A key part of that is our PR review process.

Astro docs would not be where it is without community contributions, and it would *especially* not be where it is without a careful review process to help our community members make those contributions.

This section, still a WIP, is to help educate, support and appreciate those who **review** the community contributions for quality and consistency. It is not always easy to combine community contributors and high technical writing standards. But, [it's important to us to maintain both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emgFALmCyrY), and we truly believe that this is where the magic happens in Astro docs.
