title: Documenting patch changes
description: About documenting a patch change to the Astro codebase.
---

[Patch changes](https://docs.astro.build/en/upgrade-astro/#patch-changes) are non-disruptive updates such as bug fixes or performance improvements. They usually do not require someone to update their own project code or use Astro differently.

Therefore, these code changes **typically do not include any documentation updates to Astro Docs**.

However, patch changes are still responsible for providing a **changeset** with a message for the appropriate repository's CHANGELOG.

These changesets may or may not have a docs review depending on how quickly a patch version is released. So, it is very appreciated if you [follow the advice for writing changesets](/docs-for-code-changes/pull-requests/#changesets) to provide the most helpful content for our community!
